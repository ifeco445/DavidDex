## H1 - Lack of Minimum borrow amount Would allow attackers open dust positions that would be unfavourable to liquidate

## Description
The Klend program allows user to borrow liquidity in return they pay interest for this borrowed liquidity, However when borrowing from the lend program it fails to combat attacker opening up dust positions that would be unfavaourable for liquidators to liquidate and gain rewards.

```solidity
#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
pub fn borrow_obligation_liquidity<'info, T>(
    lending_market: &LendingMarket,
    borrow_reserve: &mut Reserve,
    obligation: &mut Obligation,
@>    liquidity_amount: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
    borrow_reserve_pk: Pubkey,
    referrer_token_state: Option<RefMut<ReferrerTokenState>>,
    deposit_reserves_iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
) -> Result<CalculateBorrowResult>
where
    T: AnyAccountLoader<'info, Reserve>,
{
   
    if liquidity_amount == 0 {
        msg!("Liquidity amount provided cannot be zero");
        return err!(LendingError::InvalidAmount);
    }

    if borrow_reserve
        .last_update
        .is_stale(clock.slot, PriceStatusFlags::ALL_CHECKS)?
    {
        msg!(
            "Borrow reserve is stale and must be refreshed in the current slot, price_status: {:08b}",
          borrow_reserve.last_update.get_price_status().0
        );
        return err!(LendingError::ReserveStale);
    }
    if lending_market.is_borrowing_disabled() {
        msg!("Borrowing is disabled");
        return err!(LendingError::BorrowingDisabled);
    }
```
As we can see it only checks if the amount is zero but fails to check if amount can cover bonus for liquidation, A malicious attacker can open large dust positions to incur bad debt of the klend progam open a position with a tiny loan to value threshold this forces bad debt positions for kamino program.

## Recommended Mitigation
Enforce a mninimum liquidation amount

## H-2 Reddem fees fails to be included in withdrawal capability
## Descricption
When making redemption from reserve protocol may include them into the withdrawal_capability of the protocol , However , when redeem fees is called it fails to include it in the withdrawal_cap of the protocol.
```solidity
 if add_amount_to_withdrawal_caps {
   @>     add_to_withdrawal_accum(
            &mut reserve.config.deposit_withdrawal_cap,
            liquidity_amount,
            u64::try_from(clock.unix_timestamp).unwrap(),
        )?;
    }

    Ok(liquidity_amount)
```
As we can see when making redemption on reserves it could be included in the withdrawal_cap accumulation, However it fails to account for fees collected for each deposit this would prevent including fees to the withdrawal cap.
```solidity
pub fn redeem_fees(reserve: &mut Reserve, slot: Slot) -> Result<u64> {
    if reserve.last_update.is_stale(slot, PriceStatusFlags::NONE)? {
        msg!(
            "reserve is stale and must be refreshed in the current slot, price status: {:08b}",
            reserve.last_update.get_price_status().0
        );
        return err!(LendingError::ReserveStale);
    }

    let withdraw_amount = reserve.calculate_redeem_fees();

    if withdraw_amount == 0 {
        return err!(LendingError::InsufficientProtocolFeesToRedeem);
    }

    reserve.liquidity.redeem_fees(withdraw_amount)?;
    reserve.last_update.mark_stale();
```
As we can see fees are not accounted for in the withdrawal cap

## Recommended MITIGATION
Enforce inclusion of fees to the withdrawal cap

## H-3 Missing accrueInterest before liquidation would make protocol and lender lose accrue nterests fees
## Description
The refresh_reserves helps accumulate interests for the borrower accrding to timestamps of when the user opened a borrow position, However before liquidation protocol fails to call `refresh_reserve` to update interest of the borrower before liquidation, This oversight would make lender and protocol lose interest.
```solidity
fn process_impl(
    accounts: &LiquidateObligationAndRedeemReserveCollateral,
    remaining_accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    liquidity_amount: u64,
    min_acceptable_received_liquidity_amount: u64,
    max_allowed_ltv_override_percent: u64,
) -> Result<()> {
    xmsg!(
        "LiquidateObligationAndRedeemReserveCollateral amount {} max_allowed_ltv_override_percent {}",
        liquidity_amount,
        max_allowed_ltv_override_percent
    );

    lending_checks::liquidate_obligation_checks(accounts)?;
    lending_checks::redeem_reserve_collateral_checks(&RedeemReserveCollateralAccounts {
        user_source_collateral: accounts.user_destination_collateral.clone(),
        user_destination_liquidity: accounts.user_destination_liquidity.clone(),
        reserve: accounts.withdraw_reserve.clone(),
        reserve_liquidity_mint: accounts.withdraw_reserve_liquidity_mint.clone(),
        reserve_collateral_mint: accounts.withdraw_reserve_collateral_mint.clone(),
        reserve_liquidity_supply: accounts.withdraw_reserve_liquidity_supply.clone(),
        lending_market: accounts.lending_market.clone(),
        lending_market_authority: accounts.lending_market_authority.clone(),
        owner: accounts.liquidator.clone(),
        collateral_token_program: accounts.collateral_token_program.clone(),
        liquidity_token_program: accounts.withdraw_liquidity_token_program.clone(),
    })?;
```

As we can call no call to refresh reserve before calling the lending operations to liquidate borrowed position , this impacts the interest of the lender losses interest for liquidity provided
## Recommended Mitigation
Call accrueInterest before liquidations

## H4- Liquidation ratio amount is being truncated due to dividing fraction by raw amount
## Description
Mixing fraction with big value, rust will try to do integer division with the u64 this would truncate the remaining values of the fraction
```solidity
        if debt_amount_to_liquidate < borrowed_amount {
            msg!(
                "Liquidator-provided debt repay amount {} is too small to satisfy the required full liquidation {}",
                debt_amount_to_liquidate,
                borrowed_amount
            );
            return err!(LendingError::RepayTooSmallForFullLiquidation);
        }
        borrowed_amount
    } else {
        max_liquidatable_borrowed_amount(
            obligation,
            lending_market.liquidation_max_debt_close_factor_pct,
            lending_market.max_liquidatable_debt_market_value_at_once,
            liquidity,
            user_ltv,
            lending_market.insolvency_risk_unhealthy_ltv_pct,
            liquidation_reason,
        )
        .min(debt_amount_to_liquidate)
    };

 @>   let liquidation_ratio = debt_liquidation_amount_f / borrowed_amount;
```
https://github.com/Kamino-Finance/klend/blob/4d58ce690ee0f176ff669741915e481fb417392d/programs/klend/src/state/liquidation_operations.rs#L152

As we can see protocol wrongly tries to divide fraction by raw value this would truncate liquidators bonus rate.

## Recommended Mitgation
Convert the big value to big fraction
```solidity
use num::BigUint; // or whatever you're using for BigFraction

// safer conversion
let liquidation_ratio = debt_liquidation_amount_f
    / BigFraction::from(borrowed_amount);
```
